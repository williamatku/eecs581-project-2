project 2

agile team agreement:
27 story points (sp)
~2 hr/sp
70% of story point estimate dedicated to coding
20% testing
10% documenting

time estimates:
total = 54 hours = sp * (hr/sp), 27 * 2
coding = 38 hours = total * allocation = 54 * 0.7
testing = 11 hours = 54 * 0.2
documenting = 5 hours = 54 * 0.1
